🚀 Get a heads up on sensitive data in ChatGPT 🚀
Know when your session includes sensitive data that you shouldn't be entering into the popular generative AI tool. Just use it as you normally would and SafeType will flag instances of sensitive data before you send them.

SafeType doesn't compromise privacy and doesn't require any setup - you don't even need to log in.

⭐️ Features ⭐️
Detects 10 sensitive data classes as well as code in several languages out of the box
Highlights sensitive information, enabling the user to anonymize it in order to avoid sharing private information
Allows issues to be addressed individually or in a bulk update
SafeType configurations include disabling certain classifications, or snoozing the extension for a given web session
⭐️ Privacy ⭐️
Cyera Labs's SafeType plugin runs entirely locally by default. You don't need to create an account, grant special permissions, or connect any apps. Install it, and any time you navigate to the ChatGPT site it will automatically identify private data you type during a session.

⭐️ Community Preview ⭐️
SafeType is currently in community preview. We are gauging interest and looking for input into what would make this a more valuable tool for you and your team. Want the ability to add your sensitive data definitions? Would it help to connect this to Cyera's data security platform to get the full power of Cyera to help you secure your sessions?

⭐️ Frequently asked questions ⭐️
❔ Does SafeType use Cyera's data classification engine?
❕ No. SafeType is an open-source browser extension that bundles static classifiers for a number of commonly used data classes. SafeType is not connected to Cyera's data security platform, does not share code with the platform, and does not interact with Cyera or our customers' systems in any way.

❔ What is SafeType designed to do?
❕ ChatGPT represents an incredible potential to change and accelerate how we work. As companies and individuals engage with it, questions are being raised about how to use the platform safely. SafeType was developed to raise awareness of how common queries and activities can expose private data to it and to stop the most common examples from being accidentally disclosed. Depending on the community's interest, Cyera may integrate a proprietary version of this extension with our platform for customers.
