Know when your chat session includes sensitive data that you shouldn't be entering into the platform. Just use the popular generative AI platform as you normally would and SafeType will flag instances of sensitive data before you send them.
SafeType doesn't compromise privacy and doesn't require any setup - you don't even need to log in.

## Privacy ️

## Community Preview ️

SafeType is currently in community preview. We are gauging interest and looking for input into what would make this a more valuable tool for you and your team. Want the ability to add your sensitive data definitions? Would it help to connect this to Cyera's data security platform to get the full power of Cyera to help you secure your sessions? Let us know via our GitHub page!

## Contribution

Issues and Pull requests are highly welcomed. We are encouraging contribution mainly in the form of adding new classifiers and improving the existing ones. To improve recognizers update the file 'recognizers.js', don't forget to add tests under tests/classifier.js
